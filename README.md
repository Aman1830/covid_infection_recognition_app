# ü´Å COVID-19 Infection Recognition Application

This project uses deep learning (CNNs) to classify **COVID-positive** and **Non-COVID** chest CT scans.  
It is built using TensorFlow/Keras and deployed through a Streamlit web interface for real-time image upload and diagnosis.

> ü©∫ Aims to support medical professionals by offering a fast, lightweight, and reliable tool for automated CT scan evaluation.

## üî¨ Project Overview

COVID-19 diagnosis using CT scan imaging is crucial for timely and accurate treatment planning.  
This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** optimized with **contrastive learning-based Self-Regularization (SR)**, enhancing classification performance while keeping the model compact.

### ‚úÖ Key Highlights
- üöÄ CNN built from scratch using **TensorFlow and Keras**
- üìà Achieves up to **99.4% accuracy**
- üîÑ Real-time image augmentation with `ImageDataGenerator`
- üåê Streamlit interface for instant CT image prediction
